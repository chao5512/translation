Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.20,0:02:22.74,Default,,0,0,0,,there's a lot to learn in networking
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.80,0:02:26.26,Default,,0,0,0,,so if you have a certification it's going to be much easier for you
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.32,0:02:28.26,Default,,0,0,0,,so the two certifications that i'm recommending
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.48,0:02:30.66,Default,,0,0,0,,first the comptia network plus
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.20,0:02:33.38,Default,,0,0,0,,it's a very good one it's vendor neutral
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.52,0:02:36.90,Default,,0,0,0,,it's good to get when you are getting your feet in the industry
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.12,0:02:39.62,Default,,0,0,0,,i started with it and then i went to the ccna
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.84,0:02:41.94,Default,,0,0,0,,and the second one you might have guessed is the ccna
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.16,0:02:46.42,Default,,0,0,0,,so if you are studying for the network plus it will teach you a lot of concept of networking
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.72,0:02:48.42,Default,,0,0,0,,and it's all going to be structured
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.64,0:02:52.58,Default,,0,0,0,,for those two certifications if you want to get the books for network plus
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.32,0:02:53.38,Default,,0,0,0,,let's go on amazon
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.36,0:02:59.30,Default,,0,0,0,,if you do um network plus on amazon you get some books
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.60,0:03:01.94,Default,,0,0,0,,and i can recommend any of these books
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.16,0:03:03.94,Default,,0,0,0,,this one for example um
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.80,0:03:10.82,Default,,0,0,0,,or this other one but i i'll give you a link um to to get a book for on network plus
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.88,0:03:15.14,Default,,0,0,0,,and if you're looking for the ccna you can just um type ccna 200 301
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.00,0:03:18.15,Default,,0,0,0,,and this is what you're going to get
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.16,0:03:21.14,Default,,0,0,0,,yeah this is the the one that i prefer
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.60,0:03:24.42,Default,,0,0,0,,and if you get this one you're going to study for your cert
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.32,0:03:27.86,Default,,0,0,0,,and you will get certified after a few months of studies
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.08,0:03:32.74,Default,,0,0,0,,and you also need to check out of course the official pages of these certifications
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.44,0:03:36.46,Default,,0,0,0,,if you go on compia.com i mean comptia.org
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.12,0:03:40.58,Default,,0,0,0,,you can see this is the official page for the network plus

Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.44,0:03:52.74,Default,,0,0,0,,and some practice questions for you to know exactly what it is
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.96,0:03:56.74,Default,,0,0,0,,so personally i prefer the ccna because it's more practical practical
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.04,0:04:02.26,Default,,0,0,0,,the network plus is vendor neutral so sometimes it's kind of hard to master some concept
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.24,0:04:05.94,Default,,0,0,0,,because you don't have any vendor that you can practice on
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.00,0:04:08.82,Default,,0,0,0,,but if you go with the ccna this is the blueprint for the ccna
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.88,0:04:17.38,Default,,0,0,0,,if you just type ccna 300 um 201 i mean 200 301 blueprint
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.60,0:04:20.74,Default,,0,0,0,,this is what you get uh it's right here
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.96,0:04:25.78,Default,,0,0,0,,it's a pdf you have a list of topics or concepts that you have to know
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.44,0:04:27.22,Default,,0,0,0,,before going and taking the exam
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.52,0:04:28.98,Default,,0,0,0,,this is going to help you
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.88,0:04:32.58,Default,,0,0,0,,this is going to uh just structure whatever you have to know
