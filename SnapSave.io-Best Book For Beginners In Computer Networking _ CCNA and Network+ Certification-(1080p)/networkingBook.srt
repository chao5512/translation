00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,660
hey what's up guys this is gee here with kevin trainings

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,700
welcome to this quick video in which i'm going to respond to

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,750
a question that i receive here a lot on

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,580
kb trainings

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,380
as you know cable trainers i go from zero to engineer so most of you or some of you

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,270
are beginners in this industry in

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,500
networking in general

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,870
and you're asking yourself what are the

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,500
best books that you can read

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,180
as a beginner in networking what books can you read

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,380
to get you to master all the concept of networking

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,740
as you know here on kb trainings i share with you most of what i know and what i'm still learning in this field

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,620
so i'm a network professional

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,860
but if you've been on this channel for a while

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,340
you might have seen my video in which i talk about books

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,460
i talk about reading what i think in general is that

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,140
you should read of course

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,300
but i'm not a book guy

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,860
you know that book person who has a huge library behind him with all kind of books

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,070
it's kind of disappearing this is 2020

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,580
we have the internet we have a lot of things so i think

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,340
if you really want to read you don't need to invest into a lot of books

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,870
you should invest into something that

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,860
will make you know what you have to research on the internet

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,700
and you can pretty much read anything on google on many websites

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,140
and by the way on kb trainings i just started a blog

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,300
so i'm going to be uh writing articles in this blog here

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,420
if you go on the website and

29
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,780
you click blog um this is the first article like

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,660
most of the videos like every i mean not every

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,860
but most of the videos on this channel will be an article

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,100
this is the exact article in which i'm responding to this specific question about

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,980
the books that you can read i'm not saying that don't buy books

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,980
but you have the internet that's where you can read a lot

35
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,660
you can read most of the things on the internet

36
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,300
but if you have to buy a book or if you want to study

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,180
if you are a beginner

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,300
i'm going to advise you to get certified

39
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,100
you need to pick a certification a networking certification

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,060
and study for the cert and get the book for that specific certification

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,020
and at the end of the cert you have the knowledge

42
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,820
and your knowledge will be structured in your head

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,460
because if you are studying without any kind of plan or any kind of blueprint

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,460
you're uh going to be all over the place

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,740
there's a lot to learn in networking

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,260
so if you have a certification it's going to be much easier for you

47
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,260
so the two certifications that i'm recommending

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,660
first the comptia network plus

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,380
it's a very good one it's vendor neutral

50
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,900
it's good to get when you are getting your feet in the industry

51
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,620
i started with it and then i went to the ccna

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,940
and the second one you might have guessed is the ccna

53
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,420
so if you are studying for the network plus it will teach you a lot of concept of networking

54
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,420
and it's all going to be structured

55
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,580
for those two certifications if you want to get the books for network plus

56
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,380
let's go on amazon

57
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,300
if you do um network plus on amazon you get some books

58
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,940
and i can recommend any of these books

59
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,940
this one for example um

60
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,820
or this other one but i i'll give you a link um to to get a book for on network plus

61
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,140
and if you're looking for the ccna you can just um type ccna 200 301

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,150
and this is what you're going to get

63
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,140
yeah this is the the one that i prefer

64
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,420
and if you get this one you're going to study for your cert

65
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,860
and you will get certified after a few months of studies

66
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,740
and you also need to check out of course the official pages of these certifications

67
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,460
if you go on compia.com i mean comptia.org

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,580
you can see this is the official page for the network plus

69
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,350
it gives you the details about the exam

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,900
and if you fill out this form

71
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,020
and you submit it's going to send you

72
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,140
the exam objectives

73
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,740
and some practice questions for you to know exactly what it is

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,740
so personally i prefer the ccna because it's more practical practical

75
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,260
the network plus is vendor neutral so sometimes it's kind of hard to master some concept

76
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,940
because you don't have any vendor that you can practice on

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,820
but if you go with the ccna this is the blueprint for the ccna

78
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:17,380
if you just type ccna 300 um 201 i mean 200 301 blueprint

79
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,740
this is what you get uh it's right here

80
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,780
it's a pdf you have a list of topics or concepts that you have to know

81
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,220
before going and taking the exam

82
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,980
this is going to help you

83
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,580
this is going to uh just structure whatever you have to know

84
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,220
i also recommend to get some kind of training videos

85
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,660
i do videos myself on cabbagetrends.com if you are interested

86
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,620
but any um any trainer or any training company is able to train you

87
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,780
and walk you through the exam blueprint

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,060
until you master everything and you can go and take the exam

89
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,700
so that's uh that's what i can tell you

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,660
but again remember you have the biggest book in the world

91
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,620
you have the internet

92
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,860
you should know how to search the internet

93
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,060
you have youtube

94
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,500
you should go on youtube and watch people that are doing networking stuff

95
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,780
you yeah you have all those means of study

96
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,060
so today you can just be alone and be in your bedroom

97
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,380
but still get a lot of knowledge

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,980
because a lot of people are online just like me uh saying

99
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,180
i'm showing you what we do and showing you what is really necessary

100
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,500
in this world right now as a professional

101
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,700
