1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
what is the Network+ certification

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,970
let's go ahead and find out

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,550
hey everybody this is Zach with IT career questions

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,000
and today we are answering what is the Network+ certification

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,720
if you haven't checked out the A+ certification video

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,690
go ahead and click on this link somewhere around here

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,220
and it was our previous video about answering CompTIA certification questions

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,000
this video specifically targets the Network+ certification

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,440
what is it what do I need to know about it why am I going to take it

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,750
so the Network+ certification again is a certification that is brought to you by CompTIA

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,650
you check out CompTIA or I'll put that link in the description below

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,970
the Network+ certification is an excellent certification to get

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,760
if you are looking to get some type of networking position

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,100
if you don't have a broad knowledge base of networking

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,410
or even if you do have a broad knowledge base of networking

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,480
if you're looking for that networking job

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,330
you might want to look at getting your network plus certification

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,280
definitely is a go-to as far as networking certifications go

19
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,050
and if you don't have a degree

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,390
you can definitely fall back on a network plus certification

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,680
because it is pretty good

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,110
and of course once you do the Network+ certification

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,900
you can go off and get your CCNA and all those things

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,230
you don't have to have a college degree to get any of these certifications

25
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,190
which is definitely very excellent if that's not the route that you took

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,720
even if you do have a college degree

27
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,300
it's still suggested that you get some of these certifications

28
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,970
because employers love to see that stuff

29
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,230
anyway the Network+ certification covers everything

30
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:40,790
networking right switches VLANs land lands access points

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,130
whatever it is that has to do with networking

32
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,650
you will learn with the Network+ certification

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,620
as i talked about in my previous video

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,050
if you are looking for lots of great information

35
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,560
and want to learn more about the Network+ certifications

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,350
go ahead and check out professor masters youtube channel

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,830
he has lots of great material over there

38
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,750
and he will give you lots of great examples

39
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,350
of how the Network+ certification tests are laid out

40
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,680
and basically goes start to finish with all that stuff

41
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:16,130
so check him out for now I can give you guys a couple of examples of Network+ certifications

42
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,200
that you may receive on the test

43
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,520
again keep in mind

44
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,800
there are so many questions to this test

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,810
that no test is exactly the same

46
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,520
it's not entirely true but there's so many different versions of the test

47
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,430
that you will take that you know they just mix up the questions and things like that

48
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,060
so a couple questions here I'm going to do three of them

49
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,470
one is a user's remote marketing server has changed IP address schemes

50
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,370
and now the user can no longer access it the user

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,270
the user for further discovers that the distant

52
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,980
and still has access to them

53
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,470
which of the following is a possible cause

54
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,530
so again this is all multiple choice

55
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,340
so A is SNMP strings need to be added

56
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,890
B firewall rules need to be configured

57
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,550
C port bonding on the interface needs to be enabled

58
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,860
D the switch has lost power

59
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,310
so multiple choice what would you go with

60
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,310
if you said B firewall rules need to be configured

61
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,680
that's the right answer so something

62
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,550
happened with the firewall

63
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,650
where it lost configuration

64
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,870
maybe nobody ever configured it

65
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,030
so you're gonna have to go ahead and configure that firewall

66
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,520
and see how that needs to be set up

67
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,570
in order for this user to access the marketing server

68
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,500
the next question is which of the following is a network device

69
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,440
that allows remote users access to a network

70
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,660
A DNS server

71
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,760
B content filter

72
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,740
C load balancer

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,810
D VPN concentrator

74
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,420
so based off this multiple choice question

75
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,640
I know the answer do you know the answer

76
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,890
if you said D VPN concentrator

77
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:58,970
that's correct you will use a VPN connection to remotely access your work Business Network

78
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,360
so that's second example of a network plus certification question

79
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,620
that you could receive on the test

80
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,180
that you may go out and take

81
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,050
third and last question that we'll go over is a technician suspects

82
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,080
that a virus has been introduced on the network

83
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,570
which network resources is best used to confirm this problem

84
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,820
A syslog

85
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,500
B SNMP

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
C network sniffer

87
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,550
and D environmental monitor

88
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,690
if you said C network sniffer you're right

89
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,890
you are going to use this tool to basically sniff out any problems

90
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,660
that you may have on the network

91
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,810
so these are the three examples that I gave you on

92
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,560
questions that you may receive on the Network+ certification test

93
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,090
the Network+ certification test is a great thing to study for

94
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:55,090
because it really does give you a broad example of how an entire network works

95
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:01,180
it starts you from the very beginning until almost towards the end

96
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,550
it's not going to go too far into the security things

97
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,740
and and how a lot of more complex things are set up

98
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,530
so don't go and take a network plus certification test

99
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,890
and expect that you're going to be like a network administrator right off the bat

100
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,870
that's probably not going to happen

101
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,580
you definitely have to get years of experience

102
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,570
on basically how networks are actually set up

103
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,210
you know every business is completely different from one another

104
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,630
every business uses completely different equipment sometimes

105
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,520
you know you might have HP curse

106
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,930
which is you might have Cisco switches

107
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,530
who knows

108
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,440
so you might need to know how each different brand configures their switches

109
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,760
and how all that stuff works

110
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,780
so again Network+ certification great thing to study for

111
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,620
again I kind of talked about this in the previous video on the A+ certification

112
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,390
you should actually also get your A+ certification

113
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,160
because that's really going to give you a strong backbone of computers

114
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,870
and a little bit of networking but it's a really powerful thing that you should learn

115
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,060
because it's lots of knowledge

116
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,840
and if you are not familiar with how computers and networks and all that stuff works

117
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,450
or you're not too comfortable with it

118
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,130
these are two really good tests that you guys can take and get certified for

119
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,230
and you guys will become employable

120
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,830
right after you do that test you are almost able to go out and get a job right away

121
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,180
just based off those certifications

122
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,970
people love to see these certifications

123
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,260
they really say oh this person does actually know a lot about network

124
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,750
they went out and got their Network+ certification

125
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:39,010
that's not an easy that's not an easy certification to get by any means

126
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,460
because there's a lot of studying involved and you need to know lots of things

127
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,420
and that's mainly because the test that you're going to take

128
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,720
could be completely different the next time that you were to take it

129
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,000
so you failed the first test and you go to take the next test

130
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,300
like man I remembered all the questions that I failed on this first test

131
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,990
then you go to this to take the second test over again right

132
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,820
questions are completely different

133
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,550
every single one is completely different

134
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:09,510
so just you know if you're looking to get a certification the Network+ certification specifically

135
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,380
do your studying go check out professor Messer great resource

136
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,910
to learn a lot about the Network+ and just networking in general

137
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,200
so I hope this answers part of the question about the Network+ certification

138
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,670
I will go into broader detail and actually show you guys examples

139
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,750
in the future as you guys know I'm working on the server setup

140
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,260
and I haven't had time to do a lot of those videos

141
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,240
I apologize for that

142
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,320
but I will be trying to get as many of those videos put out as I possibly can

143
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,270
it's really hard to do those videos

144
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,760
because they do take a lot of time to do

145
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,260
but bear with me I will get to them just as I will get to you more networking videos

146
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,660
and how you can set up a switch and how you can set up a VLAN and all that fun stuff

147
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,360
so you guys have any questions you know what to do

148
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,350
hit me up in the comments below

149
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,160
be more than happy to chat with you about anything you guys have questions about

150
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,250
as always you can leave me a question and I can answer it in the video

151
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,720
just like I'm doing right now

152
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,350
thank you guys so much for watching take it easy
